# Straight To the Point (STP) Archery site

This was a group project for the HTML 100 class, HTML & CSS FOUNDATIONS.

The intent was to create a simple, 4-page layout (*home*, *services*, *about*, *contact*) for a fictitious organization, STP Archery, a non profit archery education center.

The site layout was a collaborative effort, but my design, featuring a minimal, information-focused design (playing off of the name of the organization) was the one ultimately chosen.

My contribution was the [Services Page,](https://northsouth.github.io/STP-Archery-Site/services.html) featuring a clean, responsive HTML layout.
